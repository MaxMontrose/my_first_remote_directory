# Project Goals

Work with Stephanie Mudge to explore datasets and methods for addressing her hypotheses about the use of political strategists and strategy in american politics (1860-1930, 1960-).

extract from proposal: 

> 1. How prominent are strategy/strategists in political newspaper coverage in the two periods?
Do particular figures or organizations stand out?
> 2. How does the prominence of strategy/strategists shift or vary across time, place and
context?
> 3. What is the moral valence of strategy/strategists in political newspaper coverage in the two
time periods? In other words, do references to strategists tend to be derogatory/negative or
not, and if so does this vary temporally, geographically, or in other ways?
> 4. Do terminologies that refer to strategy/strategists change over time, place or political-
economic context?
> 5. When, where and in what context do references to strategy/strategists denote specialized
professions and professionalsâ€”e.g., pollsters and political consultants who are not
politicians? How limited or extensive are networks of persons and organizations associated
with this new professional terrain?
> 6. What are the demographic, professional, and other characteristics of strategists over time?
> 7. Are strategic experts/expertise more closely associated with specific parties, or certain
issue areas, or geographical locations over time?
> 8. To what extent does the prominence of strategy/strategists covary with emphases on free
markets, fiscal conservatism, and other markers of market-centered politics?

# Project Deliverables

To be further narrowed. Main components:

1. explore and report on datasets, options for subsetting, and sampling.
2. explore and run various models including word embeddings and temporal topic models (dynamic topic models, topics over time, structural topic models).
3. explore practicality of using TDM platform.
